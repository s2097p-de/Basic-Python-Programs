"""
 Write a program to print the first 15 terms of the Fibonacci series. The sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number
 is the sum of the two preceding ones.

Exercise Purpose: The Fibonacci sequence is a classic way to learn about state management in loops. You keep track of two 
changing variables at once to find the next number, which helps you see how data moves through each step.

Given Input: Terms = 15

Expected Output: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377
"""


num1, num2 = 0, 1
print("Fibonacci series:")

for i in range(15):
    print(num1, end="  ")
    # Calculate next term
    res = num1 + num2
    # Update values for next iteration
    num1 = num2
    num2 = res
